  Append a list of events to the Store.

    - `aggregate` is the agregate that generated the events.

    - `events` is an enumberable with the events to append.

    - `options` is a keyword indicating the optimistic concurrency
      checks to perform at the moment of writing to the stream.

  ## Versioning

  Possible values are:

    - `:any`: (default value) no checks are performed, the events are
      always written

    - `:no_stream`: verifies that the target stream does not exists
      yet

    - any other value: the event number expected to currently be at

  success or `{:error, message}` in case of failure.
